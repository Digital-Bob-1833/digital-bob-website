HOW TO SET UP YOUR OPENAI API KEY
==================================

1. Create a file named ".env.local" in this folder (Cursor website for bob)

2. Add this line to the file:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-openai-api-key

3. Replace "your-actual-openai-api-key" with your real OpenAI API key

4. Save the file

Note: The .env.local file is automatically ignored by git, so your API key stays private.

For Vercel deployment, add the OPENAI_API_KEY as an Environment Variable in your Vercel project settings.
